<strong>The Right Dvorak App Information</strong>
<br />
<p>
The Right Dorvak is an open source project created and maintained by me, Taylor Shaw. I use the Dvorak-Right-Handed keyboard on my personal computer. I wanted to be able to use the same keyboard on my iPad, so I created the app.
</p>
<b>Privacy Policy</b>
<br />
<p>
Privacy is very important to us. We started collectig user data with app version 2.0. We collect minimal data in order to store your settings preferences. We store this data locally; we do not transmit any data over the network.
</p>
<p>
Another important change with app version 2.0 and later, is that we request Full Access. By pressing "Allow Full Access", you are granting the developer access to certain systems, such as Location Servics and Address Book. We need Full Acess so that we can accass your device's haptic generator in order to provide haptic feedback. If you are not using haptics with this keyboard, whether or not you Allow Full Access makes no difference.
</p>
<b>Support</b>
    <br />
    <p>
    We offer no support for this product. You can email tay@taylorcodeshop.com if you would like to notify the developer of any bugs.
